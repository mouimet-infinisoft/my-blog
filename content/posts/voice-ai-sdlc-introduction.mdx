description: Sharing my experience building software through voice conversation with AI teammates - an experimental approach to development.
status: published
---

> **Note:** This article offers a **high-level overview** of my experiment with voice-driven software development. It focuses on the *approach*, *outcomes*, and *lessons learned*, rather than deep technical implementation details. If this approach generates interest, I‚Äôll follow up with a more in-depth, technical breakdown in a future article.

---

**TL;DR:**
- Built a social services platform MVP using only voice conversation
- Used AI-SDLC framework with MCP-compatible LLMs as teammates
- Completed first draft in 6 weeks, including 197 GitHub issues and 50+ database tables
- Experimental approach combining structured SDLC with AI collaboration
- Demo available at [sisimple.vercel.app](https://sisimple.vercel.app/)
- Framework at [github.com/mouimet-infinisoft/AISDLC](https://github.com/mouimet-infinisoft/AISDLC)

## 1. My Journey to This Moment

I'm a software engineer with 25 years of experience, and for the past five years, I've been pursuing an idea: building iBrain, an AI teammate for software development through natural conversation.

The journey hasn't been easy. I've tried thousands of approaches that didn't work, but each failure taught me something valuable. My GitHub contribution graph from 2022 shows this dedication - 3,902 contributions, working almost every day of the year.

## 2. What I Built

A few years ago, I led a team of five developers in creating a social services management platform. The project lasted three years but, for various reasons, never reached deployment.

Recently, I challenged myself to rebuild this platform solo, applying an experimental approach I had been developing since iBrain: the AI-SDLC framework. Starting from an empty folder and relying solely on voice conversations, I successfully built a complete multi-tenant SaaS platform.

### üöÄ Key Features Built

### Development Process

Through voice conversation, the AI teammates:
1. Created complete project documentation and planning
2. Scaffolded the entire project structure
3. Broke down work into GitHub issues with proper hierarchy
4. Implemented features with continuous review
5. Generated comprehensive technical documentation

**üìå GitHub Project Board Integration**

Visual project management using GitHub milestones and issue hierarchy to track development progress and roadmap alignment.

**üß± Hierarchical Issue Management**

Supports a three-level issue structure with clear parent-child relationships, enhancing task traceability and accountability.

---

**üóÇ Case Management Timeline**

Dedicated interface for viewing case progression, attaching documentation, and managing case notes across the lifecycle.

My role was primarily supervision and direction - the AI teammates handled the implementation details while I focused on strategic decisions.

### üöÄ Try It Yourself

See the result in action:

- **Password**: Password123!

What makes this particularly interesting is that while it took 6 weeks, much of that time was spent developing the AI-SDLC framework itself. With the framework now established, similar projects could potentially be completed much faster.

## 3. Results & Metrics

Starting from an empty folder, through voice conversations with AI teammates, we created:

**Project Structure & Documentation:**
- 197 GitHub issues organized in a three-level hierarchy
- 14 development milestones with clear progression
- Complete technical specifications and architecture documents
- API documentation and implementation guides

**Technical Implementation:**
- 50+ database tables with proper normalization and relationships
- 100+ React components following consistent patterns
- 40+ database migrations with rollback capability
- Full authentication and authorization system
- Multi-tenant data segregation with row-level security
- Template engine for document generation
- Workflow automation system

**Quality Assurance:**
- Test coverage across core functionality
- Basic CI/CD pipeline setup
- Security policy implementation

All of this was achieved through natural conversation - I supervised and made strategic decisions while the AI teammates handled implementation details and documentation.

The resulting first draft MVP includes all core features needed for a production system, though it would need significant iteration and refinement before actual deployment.

## 5. The Experimental Framework

The AI-SDLC framework combines structured development practices with AI collaboration through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Here's how it works:

### AI-SDLC Workflow

The development process follows two main phases:

#### Phase 1: Strategic Planning & Design

| Step | AI Teammate | Deliverable | Human Role |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **1.1** | Sarah | Business Case | Strategic Input |
| **1.2** | Sarah | BRD & URD | Requirements Review |
| **1.3** | Alex | SRS & ADD | Technical Approval |
| **1.4** | Jordan | Project Structure | Workflow Approval |
| **2.1** | Taylor | FRS & Database Design | Functional Review |
| **2.2** | Casey | Implementation Plan | Development Strategy |

#### Phase 2: Implementation & Delivery

| Step | AI Teammate | Deliverable | Human Role |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **2.3** | Jordan | Task Coordination | Progress Tracking |
| **2.4** | Mike/Riley | Code Implementation | Code Review |
| **3.1** | Sam | Quality Assurance | Quality Approval |
| **3.2** | Morgan | Deployment | Production Release |

### How We Collaborate

The framework connects these AI teammates through an MCP-compatible application, allowing natural voice discussions about development tasks. I tested this successfully with GitHub Copilot and Augment Code, though it should work with any LLM that supports MCP.

Each conversation follows a structured workflow:
1. Discuss requirements and objectives with Sarah and Taylor
2. Plan technical approach with Alex and Casey
3. Implement solutions with Mike and Riley
4. Review and validate with Sam

The AI teammates maintain context throughout the development process while following standard SDLC practices.

Components used:
- Standard tools: VS Code, GitHub
- AI Platforms: GitHub Copilot, Augment Code
- Custom tools: Voice MCP, Diagram MCP, N8N MCP
- Tech stack: Next.js 15, React 19, Supabase, PostgreSQL

## 6. Voice-Based Discussion Approach

Instead of typing commands or code, I expressed ideas through natural conversation. The AI teammates:
- Asked clarifying questions
- Proposed solutions
- Implemented features
- Created pull requests
- Maintained code quality

This wasn't about voice commands - it was collaborative problem-solving through conversation.

## 7. Key Differences

Traditional development involves significant coordination overhead between requirements, implementation, and validation.

This experimental approach:
- Reduced communication overhead
- Enabled rapid iteration
- Maintained engineering standards
- Preserved project context
- Generated documentation automatically

## 8. Challenges & Solutions

What worked well:
- Complex algorithm implementation
- Database schema design
- Architecture consistency
- Documentation generation

What needed iteration:
- UI refinement
- Edge case handling

Specific challenges we solved:
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Resource scheduling conflicts
- Workflow state management
- Document generation templates

## 9. Conclusion: Learning from the Experiment

This experiment demonstrated one possible approach to software development using voice-based AI collaboration. While the results are encouraging, this is just an early exploration.

The [AI-SDLC framework](https://github.com/mouimet-infinisoft/AISDLC) shows potential for:
- Structured development through conversation
- Maintaining engineering standards with AI assistance
- Documenting and managing complex projects

I share this experience not to predict the future of software development, but to contribute to our collective understanding of human-AI collaboration in building software.
