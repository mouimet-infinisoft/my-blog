# Testing with @brainstack/inject: Mocking and Swapping Dependencies

## Introduction

In this article, we will explore how to test your applications using `@brainstack/inject`, including techniques for mocking and swapping dependencies.

## Mocking Dependencies

Mocking dependencies allows you to isolate the unit of code you are testing by replacing real dependencies with mock implementations.

### Example: Mocking a Service

Let's say we have a `DatabaseService` that we want to mock in our tests.

```typescript
import { Service } from '@brainstack/inject';

@Service()
class DatabaseService {
  getData() {
    return 'Real data from database';
  }
}
```

We can create a mock implementation of `DatabaseService` for testing purposes.

```typescript
class MockDatabaseService {
  getData() {
    return 'Mock data';
  }
}
```

### Using the Mock in Tests

We can use the mock implementation in our tests by registering it with the container.

```typescript
import { Container } from '@brainstack/inject';
import { MyClass } from './MyClass'; // The class that depends on DatabaseService

const container = new Container();
container.register(DatabaseService, new MockDatabaseService());

const myInstance = container.getInstance(MyClass);
console.log(myInstance.doSomething()); // Output: 'Mock data'
```

## Swapping Dependencies

Swapping dependencies allows you to replace real implementations with mock or alternative implementations during testing.

### Example: Swapping a Service

Let's say we have a `LoggerService` that we want to swap with a mock implementation in our tests.

```typescript
import { SingletonService } from '@brainstack/inject';

@SingletonService
class LoggerService {
  log(message: string) {
    console.log(message);
  }
}
```

We can create a mock implementation of `LoggerService` for testing purposes.

```typescript
class MockLoggerService {
  log(message: string) {
    // Do nothing
  }
}
```

### Using the Mock in Tests

We can use the mock implementation in our tests by registering it with the container.

```typescript
import { Container } from '@brainstack/inject';
import { MyClass } from './MyClass'; // The class that depends on LoggerService

const container = new Container();
container.register(LoggerService, new MockLoggerService());

const myInstance = container.getInstance(MyClass);
myInstance.doSomething(); // No log output
```

## Resetting the Container

Resetting the container is useful for ensuring a clean state between tests.

```typescript
container.reset();
```

## Conclusion

By leveraging mocking and swapping dependencies, you can effectively test your applications using `@brainstack/inject`. These techniques allow you to isolate the unit of code you are testing and ensure that your tests are reliable and maintainable. This concludes our series on `@brainstack/inject`.
