# Test Newsletter Article

This is a test article created to verify that the newsletter sender functionality works correctly.

## Purpose

The purpose of this article is to:

1. Test the automated newsletter system
2. Verify that the cron job correctly identifies newly published content
3. Ensure that subscribers receive notifications about new content

This article should be automatically detected by the newsletter sender because it has:
- Today's date as the publication date
- "published" status

If you're reading this in an email, the newsletter system is working correctly!
