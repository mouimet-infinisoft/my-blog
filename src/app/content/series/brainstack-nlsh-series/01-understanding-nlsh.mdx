# Understanding Natural Language Shell with @brainstack/nlsh

## Introduction

Terminal interactions have traditionally required users to memorize specific commands and syntax. @brainstack/nlsh changes this paradigm by introducing a natural language interface to your terminal, powered by AI understanding.

## What is @brainstack/nlsh?

@brainstack/nlsh is an AI-powered natural language shell that:
- Understands commands expressed in plain English
- Identifies and suggests appropriate terminal commands
- Executes commands with configurable trust levels
- Provides feedback mechanisms for command execution
- Makes terminal interaction more intuitive and accessible

## Core Concepts

### Natural Language Understanding

Instead of remembering exact command syntax, you can express your intent naturally:

```typescript
// Traditional way
$ lsof -i :44253

// With @brainstack/nlsh
> show me process including pid listening on port 44253
```

The AI understands your intention and translates it into the appropriate command.

### Trust Levels

@brainstack/nlsh implements a trust system for command execution:

```typescript
import { Nlsh, TrustLevel } from '@brainstack/nlsh';

const nlsh = new Nlsh({
  trustLevel: TrustLevel.AUTONOMOUS,  // Execute without confirmation
  // or
  trustLevel: TrustLevel.INTERACTIVE  // Ask for confirmation
});
```

### Command Feedback

The system learns from user feedback:

```plaintext
> what is my hostname?
Explanations:
This command will display your hostname.
Commands to be executed:
hostname
Do you approve the following commands? (y/N): y
WINDOWS
Feedback: Did it do what you expected? (y/N): y
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @brainstack/nlsh

# Using yarn
yarn add @brainstack/nlsh
```

### Basic Setup

```typescript
import { Nlsh } from '@brainstack/nlsh';

// Create instance with default settings
const nlsh = new Nlsh();

// Or with custom configuration
const nlsh = new Nlsh({
  inputSource: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
  trustLevel: 'INTERACTIVE',
  feedbackEnabled: true
});

// Start the shell
nlsh.start();
```

## Common Use Cases

### System Information Queries

Ask about system status in plain English:

```plaintext
> show me running docker containers
// Lists all running Docker containers

> what's using port 3000?
// Shows processes using port 3000

> show me system memory usage
// Displays memory statistics
```

### File Operations

Perform file operations naturally:

```plaintext
> find all JavaScript files modified today
// Translates to appropriate find command

> show me the largest files in this directory
// Executes du/ls with proper sorting

> create a backup of my config files
// Identifies and backs up configuration files
```

### Network Operations

Handle network tasks intuitively:

```plaintext
> check if website example.com is up
// Performs ping/curl as needed

> show me active network connections
// Translates to netstat with appropriate flags

> display my routing table
// Shows network routing information
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Intent Expression**
   - Be specific about what you want
   - Include relevant details
   - Use natural, conversational language

2. **Trust Level Management**
   - Start with INTERACTIVE mode for learning
   - Graduate to AUTONOMOUS for trusted operations
   - Maintain caution with system-critical commands

3. **Feedback Participation**
   - Provide honest feedback about command execution
   - Help the system learn from interactions
   - Report unexpected behaviors

4. **Command Verification**
   - Review suggested commands before approval
   - Understand what each command does
   - Pay attention to potential risks

## Integration Example

Here's how to integrate @brainstack/nlsh into a Node.js application:

```typescript
import { Nlsh, CommandResult } from '@brainstack/nlsh';

class CustomShell {
  private nlsh: Nlsh;

  constructor() {
    this.nlsh = new Nlsh({
      trustLevel: 'INTERACTIVE',
      feedbackEnabled: true,
      onCommandExecuted: this.handleCommandResult
    });
  }

  private handleCommandResult = (result: CommandResult) => {
    if (result.success) {
      console.log('Command executed successfully:', result.output);
    } else {
      console.error('Command failed:', result.error);
    }
  }

  async executeCommand(input: string) {
    try {
      await this.nlsh.processInput(input);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error processing command:', error);
    }
  }

  start() {
    this.nlsh.start();
    console.log('Natural language shell started. Type your commands...');
  }
}

// Usage
const shell = new CustomShell();
shell.start();
```

## Conclusion

@brainstack/nlsh represents a significant evolution in terminal interaction, making command-line operations more accessible through natural language understanding. Its AI-powered interface and feedback system create a more intuitive and user-friendly terminal experience.
