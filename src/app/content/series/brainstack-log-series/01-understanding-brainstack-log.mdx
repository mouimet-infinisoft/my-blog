## Introduction

Effective logging is crucial for understanding application behavior, debugging issues, and monitoring system health. In this article, we'll explore how @brainstack/log provides a flexible and powerful logging solution for JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

## What is @brainstack/log?

@brainstack/log is a logging package designed to provide flexible and customizable logging capabilities. It offers:

- Multiple log levels (log, info, warn, error, verbose)
- Customizable logger integrations
- Flexible log level management
- Type-safe logging (in TypeScript)

## Core Concepts

### Log Levels

@brainstack/log supports different log levels to categorize messages based on their importance:

```typescript
import { createLogger, consoleIntegration } from '@brainstack/log';

const logger = createLogger(3, [consoleIntegration]);

logger.verbose('Debug information'); // Lowest priority
logger.log('General message');
logger.info('Important information');
logger.warn('Warning message');
logger.error('Error message'); // Highest priority
```

### Logger Integrations

The package uses a flexible integration system that allows you to output logs to different destinations:

```typescript
import { createLogger, LoggerIntegration } from '@brainstack/log';

// Custom integration example
const fileIntegration: LoggerIntegration = {
  log: (message) => writeToFile('log.txt', message),
  info: (message) => writeToFile('info.txt', message),
  warn: (message) => writeToFile('warnings.txt', message),
  error: (message) => writeToFile('errors.txt', message),
  verbose: (message) => writeToFile('verbose.txt', message),
};

const logger = createLogger(3, [fileIntegration]);
```

### Dynamic Log Levels

Log levels can be changed at runtime to adjust logging verbosity:

```typescript
const logger = createLogger(3); // Start with level 3

// Later in the application
logger.changeLogLevel(4); // Increase verbosity
logger.changeLogLevel(2); // Reduce logging
```

## Best Practices

1. **Structured Logging**
   - Use consistent log formats
   - Include relevant context
   - Add timestamps and correlation IDs

2. **Appropriate Log Levels**
   - Use verbose for debugging details
   - Use info for important operations
   - Use warn for potential issues
   - Use error for actual problems

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Avoid expensive operations in log messages
   - Use appropriate log levels in production
   - Consider log rotation and cleanup

4. **Security**
   - Never log sensitive information
   - Sanitize user input
   - Follow compliance requirements

## Integration with Brainstack Framework

@brainstack/log integrates seamlessly with other Brainstack packages:

- Works with @brainstack/hub for event logging
- Integrates with @brainstack/store for state changes
- Supports @brainstack/bridge-client for distributed logging

## Conclusion

@brainstack/log provides a solid foundation for implementing effective logging in your applications. Its flexible design allows for easy customization while maintaining simplicity and performance.
